        "unwrapped_text": "Okay, here\u2019s a short story about Simba incorporating those five questions, aiming for a coherent and engaging narrative:\n\nSimba paced restlessly in the shade of Pride Rock, a furrow in his golden mane. He\u2019d been wrestling with a particularly frustrating problem \u2013 a feeling of being stuck, of not quite *fitting* into his role as king. His wise old uncle, Zazu, perched on a nearby boulder, observing him with a knowing glint in his eye.\n\n\u201cYou seem troubled, young Simba,\u201d Zazu said, adjusting his spectacles. \u201cPerhaps a bit of distraction is what you need.\u201d\n\nSimba sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 everything feels so complicated. I keep thinking about how my father, Mufasa, was so sure of himself. He always said, 'If I Were a Rich Man,' and it was a huge hit from the stage show *The Lion King*! It\u2019s just\u2026 I feel like I need to be *more* than just a king, like I need to prove something.\u201d\n\nZazu chuckled. \u201cA noble sentiment, but a heavy burden. Speaking of proving things, do you know why Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn\u2019s Island were two sequels to *Moby Dick*? It was Herman Melville, a brilliant but often troubled writer, who expanded on the story of Ahab\u2019s obsession.\u201d\n\nSimba shook his head, still lost in thought. \u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t. That\u2019s fascinating.  I was just reading about Truman Capote, and it\u2019s strange \u2013 his birth name was Albert Clark.  His stepfather, Lucille Hammer, adopted him and changed his name. It\u2019s a reminder that family isn't always about blood.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a frantic messenger burst into the clearing. \u201cYour Majesty! The trackers have found something incredible! They\u2019ve followed the snark\u2019s trail to the Whispering Woods!\u201d\n\nSimba rushed to the edge of the rock, peering into the dense foliage.  The trackers were huddled around a bizarre sight \u2013 a shimmering, iridescent puddle that pulsed with light.  \u201cLewis Carroll\u2019s poem, *The Hunting of the Snark*, always intrigued me,\u201d Simba mused. \u201cRemember how the snark turned into a giant, glittering bubble to fool the hunters?

        "raw_generated_text": "Okay, here\u2019s a short story about Simba incorporating those five questions, aiming for a coherent and engaging narrative:\n\nSimba paced restlessly in the shade of Pride Rock, a furrow in his golden mane. He\u2019d been wrestling with a particularly frustrating problem \u2013 a feeling of being stuck, of not quite *fitting* into his role as king. His wise old uncle, Zazu, perched on a nearby boulder, observing him with a knowing glint in his eye.\n\n\u201cYou seem troubled, young Simba,\u201d Zazu said, adjusting his spectacles. \u201cPerhaps a bit of distraction is what you need.\u201d\n\nSimba sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 everything feels so complicated. I keep thinking about how my father, Mufasa, was so sure of himself. He always said, 'If I Were a Rich Man,' and it was a huge hit from the stage show *The Lion King*! It\u2019s just\u2026 I feel like I need to be *more* than just a king, like I need to prove something.\u201d\n\nZazu chuckled. \u201cA noble sentiment, but a heavy burden. Speaking of proving things, do you know why Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn\u2019s Island were two sequels to *Moby Dick*? It was Herman Melville, a brilliant but often troubled writer, who expanded on the story of Ahab\u2019s obsession.\u201d\n\nSimba shook his head, still lost in thought. \u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t. That\u2019s fascinating.  I was just reading about Truman Capote, and it\u2019s strange \u2013 his birth name was Albert Clark.  His stepfather, Lucille Hammer, adopted him and changed his name. It\u2019s a reminder that family isn't always about blood.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a frantic messenger burst into the clearing. \u201cYour Majesty! The trackers have found something incredible! They\u2019ve followed the snark\u2019s trail to the Whispering Woods!\u201d\n\nSimba rushed to the edge of the rock, peering into the dense foliage.  The trackers were huddled around a bizarre sight \u2013 a shimmering, iridescent puddle that pulsed with light.  \u201cLewis Carroll\u2019s poem, *The Hunting of the Snark*, always intrigued me,\u201d Simba mused. \u201cRemember how the snark turned into a giant, glittering bubble to fool the hunters? It\u2019s a wonderfully absurd image.\u201d\n\nAs he watched, the bubble popped, and a tiny, bewildered hummingbird fluttered out.  \u201cAnd speaking of strange occurrences,\u201d Zazu added, pointing to the sky, \u201cDid you know that in the Bible, the sun and moon stood still before the Lord opened the floodgates of judgment?

He\u2019d been trying, and failing, to convince his classmates that *he* was the chosen one for Santa\u2019s letter \u2013 a truly monumental task. Suddenly, a vibrant, swirling vortex of color erupted from the sky, depositing a small, bewildered beagle named Spike right in the middle of the schoolyard. \n\nSpike, it turned out, was a scout for a legendary, lost beagle named Snoopy, a famous adventurer. Snoopy, you see, was obsessed with finding the mythical Island of Mz. McSquared, a place rumored to be overflowing with delicious sausages.  Spike explained that **which rodent rears its young, called kittens, in a nest called a drey** \u2013 a clever squirrel named Squeaky \u2013 had been tracking Snoopy\u2019s movements and believed he\u2019d left a clue. \n\nFollowing Squeaky\u2019s directions, they discovered a massive, intricately built lodge nestled deep in the woods. **Which mammal constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter?** A grumpy old beaver named Bartholomew grumbled about the intrusion, but Snoopy, ever the charmer, convinced him to share a map. \n\nThe map led them to a murky swamp, where they encountered a patch of lush, green plants thriving in the water. **What is the generic word for plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions?**  \"Hydrophytes!\" Snoopy declared, pointing with his paw. \u201cPerfect for a sausage picnic!\u201d \n\nAs they navigated the swamp, Charlie Brown, surprisingly, noticed something peculiar.  \u201cLook!\u201d he exclaimed, pointing to a discarded eggshell. \u201cWhen the egg is released from the ovary, **what is left behind?**\u201d  The shell, of course.  It was a vital piece of the puzzle. \n\nFinally, after a series of hilarious mishaps involving a runaway sled and a very confused Lucy, they arrived at the Island of Mz. McSquared.  But just as they were about to feast, a rhythmic, steady beat pulsed through the air.  \u201cWait!\u201d Snoopy shouted, consulting a small, leather-bound book. \u201cThis island is powered by the heart of a giant, ancient tortoise! **What is the scientific name for the heart\u2019s pacemaker?**  It\u2019s called the sinoatrial node \u2013 or SA node!\u201d \n\nThe SA node, triggered by the tortoise\u2019s heartbeat, activated a series of levers and pulleys, revealing a mountain of sausages!

So many people, so many lives.\u201d \n\nHogie then began to explain about a woman named Nadia Com\u0103neci, a gymnast who had revolutionized the sport. \u201cShe scored **seven maximum scores of 10** at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, winning three gold medals, one silver and one bronze!  It was incredible!\u201d \n\nSuddenly, Hogie\u2019s sensors picked up a signal \u2013 a faint, rhythmic pulse. It led them to a recording of a young Soviet gymnast, Luigina Giavotti.  \u201cShe was incredibly young,\u201d Hogie said, his voice filled with a strange reverence. \u201c**In 1928, she was just 13 years and 133 days old** when she won a silver medal in gymnastics.  She\u2019s still the youngest person to ever win an Olympic medal!\u201d \n\nHogie paused, his metallic eyes focusing on Hogie. \u201cI need to go,\u201d he said, a hint of sadness in his voice. \u201cBut I\u2019ll always remember our games.  I\u2019ll always remember you.\u201d  He then launched himself into the sky, a silver silhouette against the rain, leaving Hogie standing alone in the cornfield, clutching a baseball and a newfound understanding of friendship and sacrifice.

You\u2019re focusing on the *impact*, but not the *presentation*.\u201d It was Ms. Ito, a former champion known for her sharp eye for design. \u201cThink about **Alexander McQueen**.

He launched a particularly aggressive attack, aiming for Inferno\u2019s core. \n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Ms. Ito said, a small smile playing on her lips, \u201cremember **Winona Ryder**. She played Kate Flax in *Mermaids*. She was strong, independent, and fiercely determined.

Remember that brilliant comedy, *The Hullabaloo*, written by Johnny Speight? The one with the bloke who screamed about \u2018come on you Irons\u2019 every five minutes?\u201d Anger roared, projecting a grainy image of a jubilant West Ham fan onto the wall. \n\nJust then, a calm, methodical voice cut through the chaos. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget the classics,\u201d said Sadness, projecting a faded black and white screen. \u201cLike *Last of the Summer Wine*, written by Galton and Simpson. Fifty-seven episodes of gentle Yorkshire life! It\u2019s a grounding influence.\u201d  The screen showed a scene of Bonar Law, looking remarkably serene, enjoying a cup of tea. \u201cAnd speaking of grounding,\u201d Sadness continued, \u201cremember Bonar Law? He was born in\u2026 Canada!\u201d \n\nA tiny, fluffy rabbit popped up on a miniature screen \u2013 Pooh. \u201cOh, bother,\u201d he said, looking bewildered. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to explain to Piglet that we need to find Christopher Robin. He\u2019s been awfully quiet lately.  You know, he lives in the Hundred Acre Wood, and he\u2019s terribly worried about us.\u201d \n\nJoy took a deep breath, finally regaining control. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, a small smile returning to her face. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve got a lot of memories to sort through.  Let\u2019s start with the tea, the football, and a very important rabbit.\u201d \n\n---\n\nDo you want me to tweak the story, add more details, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of it?",

Tonight, the regulars \u2013 a motley crew of retired entertainers and curious locals \u2013 were gathered for their weekly dose of nostalgia and, of course, Sing. \n\nCecil \u201cSing\u201d Harding, a man whose voice had once filled grand theaters, was struggling to remember the lyrics to a particularly tricky ballad. \u201cBlast it all,\u201d he grumbled, adjusting his bow tie. \u201cI\u2019ve completely forgotten the verse!\u201d \n\nHis long-time friend, Arthur Penhaligon, a former stage manager who\u2019d been playing the role of the club\u2019s perpetually exasperated caretaker for years, chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been spending too much time with **Jack Lord** lately, Sing. He\u2019s always reminding you to keep your memory sharp!\u201d Jack Lord, a legendary detective from *Hawaii Five-O*, had been a frequent visitor to the club, captivated by Sing\u2019s stories. \n\nSuddenly, a booming voice cut through the room. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, old boy! I\u2019ve got it!\u201d It was Rik Van Nutter, a flamboyant illusionist who\u2019d once toured with **Cec Linder**, pulling a rabbit from his hat with a flourish. \u201cSpeaking of memories, did you know that **Harry Houdini** was the first to introduce us to Basil Brush, the clever little rabbit?\u201d \n\nThe conversation drifted, as it always did, to historical trivia. \u201cYou know,\u201d David Hedison, a retired opera singer with a penchant for dramatic pronouncements, declared, \u201cthe only Prime Minister of Britain to be assassinated was Lord Byng in 1948!\u201d \n\nJust then, David Hedison (no relation to the opera singer, he insisted) piped up, \u201cSpeaking of tragic events, I was just reading about the **SS Star Doradus** \u2013 the ferry that capsized after leaving Zeebrugge in 1987. A terrible disaster.\u201d \n\nJeffrey Wright, a quiet, observant man who always seemed to be sketching in a notebook, added, \u201cIt\u2019s a sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of the sea.  It\u2019s located in the **Palawan archipelago**, a chain of islands in the southwestern Philippines.\u201d \n\nSing, finally remembering the lyrics, launched into the song with gusto. As the music swelled, a smile spread across his face.  \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, his voice filled with warmth, \u201cit\u2019s moments like these, surrounded by friends and a little bit of chaos, that make it all worthwhile.\u201d \n\nThe Sing-Along Club, a haven for forgotten memories and shared laughter, continued its evening, a testament to the enduring power of music and the joy of remembering.",

He\u2019d arrived a week ago, chasing a rumour \u2013 a whisper of a lost botanist, Professor Silas Blackwood, who\u2019d vanished into the island\u2019s dense rainforests decades ago. Leo, a freelance journalist with a penchant for the obscure, was determined to find out what happened to him. \n\nHis research had started with a strange connection to a 1970s disco craze. He\u2019d been tracking down the origins of a rare orchid, the \u2018Midnight Bloom,\u2019 which was said to have been a favourite of Blackwood. The orchid\u2019s legend was intertwined with a peculiar detail: Blackwood had been obsessed with a particular song, \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive,\u201d and the name of the character played by John Travolta in *Saturday Night Fever* \u2013 **Tony Manero**.  It seemed a bizarre link, but Leo was convinced it held a clue.\n\nDigging deeper, he discovered that Michael Caine had appeared with his brother Stanley in **\u201cGet Carter\u201d** in 1969, a gritty crime drama that mirrored the darker undercurrents of Blackwood\u2019s research. The professor, it turned out, had been investigating the illegal trade of rare plants, a dangerous game in this remote corner of the world. \n\nThe investigation led him to a chilling incident. In 1969, a man named Danny O\u2019Malley was tragically murdered at a Rolling Stones concert. The details were murky, but it was confirmed that a member of the Hell\u2019s Angels was responsible. The concert had been held in **London, at Wembley Stadium**.  Leo felt a shiver crawl down his spine \u2013 Blackwood\u2019s research had clearly attracted unwanted attention.\n\nAs he ventured further into the rainforest, he consulted an old, weathered map Blackwood had left behind. The map referenced a specific astronomical alignment, a celestial event that occurred roughly **8 minutes and 20 seconds** \u2013 the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth.  This alignment, Blackwood believed, held the key to unlocking the secrets of the Midnight Bloom. \n\nFinally, he stumbled upon a hidden cave, and inside, he found Blackwood\u2019s journal. The last entry described a peculiar experiment involving a type of pasta \u2013 **Anellini pasta**, shaped like tiny rings, which Blackwood believed contained a unique bioluminescent compound, the very essence of the orchid\u2019s glow. \n\nLeo realized Blackwood hadn\u2019t vanished; he\u2019d been experimenting, pushing the boundaries of botany, and ultimately, becoming a victim of the very forces he\u2019d sought to understand.  As he closed the journal, a single, perfect Midnight Bloom, glowing faintly in the darkness, seemed to acknowledge his discovery, a silent testament to a forgotten scientist and a lost piece of Madagascar\u2019s history.",

In 1969, a man named Danny O\u2019Malley was tragically murdered at a Rolling Stones concert. The details were murky, but it was confirmed that a member of the Hell\u2019s Angels was responsible. The concert had been held in **London, at Wembley Stadium**.  Leo felt a shiver crawl down his spine \u2013 Blackwood\u2019s research had clearly attracted unwanted attention.\n\nAs he ventured further into the rainforest, he consulted an old, weathered map Blackwood had left behind. The map referenced a specific astronomical alignment, a celestial event that occurred roughly **8 minutes and 20 seconds** \u2013 the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth.  This alignment, Blackwood believed, held the key to unlocking the secrets of the Midnight Bloom. \n\nFinally, he stumbled upon a hidden cave, and inside, he found Blackwood\u2019s journal. The last entry described a peculiar experiment involving a type of pasta \u2013 **Anellini pasta**, shaped like tiny rings, which Blackwood believed contained a unique bioluminescent compound, the very essence of the orchid\u2019s glow. \n\nLeo realized Blackwood hadn\u2019t vanished; he\u2019d been experimenting, pushing the boundaries of botany, and ultimately, becoming a victim of the very forces he\u2019d sought to understand.  As he closed the journal, a single, perfect Midnight Bloom, glowing faintly in the darkness, seemed to acknowledge his discovery, a silent testament to a forgotten scientist and a lost piece of Madagascar\u2019s history.",

This place is run by a collector obsessed with stealing memories, and he\u2019s using a device powered by\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a very complicated system involving a lot of musical notes.\u201d Denver explained that the collector, a disgruntled former animator named Silas Grim, had been using stolen memories to create incredibly powerful illusions. \n\n\u201cGrim\u2019s been obsessed with capturing the *feeling* of things,\u201d Denver continued, \u201cand he\u2019s been using songs to fuel his machine. You might recognize some of them \u2013 **Annie\u2019s Song** and **Rocky Mountain High** were particularly potent.\u201d \n\nJust then, a chaotic shout erupted from a nearby clearing. Brave rushed over to find a group of young heroes battling a giant, robotic badger. Leading the charge was **Benny the Ball**, a surprisingly agile sphere, alongside **Brain**, a brilliant but slightly scatterbrained inventor, and **Choo Choo**, a train-shaped robot who could shoot puffs of steam. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stop him from stealing the memories of the annual Fun Fair!\u201d Benny yelled. \u201cBut he\u2019s got a whole army of miniature robots!\u201d \n\nAs Brave engaged the robots, he noticed a small, nervous figure huddled behind a stack of hay bales. It was **Simple Simon**, looking utterly bewildered. \u201cI\u2026 I was just on my way to the fair,\u201d Simon stammered, \u201cand I met a talking scarecrow who warned me about Silas Grim! He said he was going to steal all the joy from the whole town!\u201d \n\nSuddenly, a familiar, grumpy face popped up from behind a giant inflatable banana. It was **Dennis the Menace**, looking thoroughly unimpressed. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Dennis grumbled, \u201ctalking scarecrows and stolen joy? It\u2019s always something with you lot.\u201d He\u2019d first appeared in **The Beano** comic strip way back in 1951, a fact that seemed to momentarily distract even Brave. \n\nWith the combined efforts of Brave, Benny, Brain, Choo Choo, Simple Simon, and even a reluctantly helpful Dennis the Menace, they managed to overload Grim\u2019s machine and restore the stolen memories. As the portal shimmered closed, Denver strummed a final chord. \u201cWell done, Brave,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve saved the day\u2026 and a whole lot of memories.\u201d",

Both monarchs stepped down amidst the Russian Revolution.\u201d\n\nThe projector then cycled through a montage of dramatic scenes, culminating in a chilling portrait of a man in a dark cloak. \u201cThis\u2026 this is unsettling,\u201d Wall-E murmured. \u201c**Whose last words were \u2018Et Tu, Brute\u2019 according to Shakespeare?**\u201d He paused, analyzing the image. \u201cJulius Caesar! A truly tragic betrayal.\u201d\n\nThen, the screen exploded with a familiar face \u2013 a grizzled, determined actor. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Wall-E exclaimed, recognizing the actor. \"**Mel Gibson (1990) and Kenneth Branagh (1996) have both played which character in movies?**\u201d He quickly identified the role. \u201cSheriff Woody! From *Toy Story*!\u201d \n\nThe projector sputtered and finally settled on a group of smiling men in a studio lot. \u201cAnd this,\u201d Wall-E announced, \u201cis fascinating. **The original United Artists film studio was founded in 1919 by D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and who else?**\u201d He processed the information. \u201cSamuel Goldwyn! A key figure in shaping the studio\u2019s early success.\u201d\n\nAs the image faded, Wall-E felt a strange, almost wistful sensation. He wasn\u2019t just collecting junk; he was preserving echoes of a world that had been, a world filled with music, revolution, betrayal, and the birth of a cinematic legend. He continued his work, a tiny, lonely robot, diligently safeguarding the fragments of humanity\u2019s story, one discarded memory at a time.",

He much preferred berries. \n\nAs the grasshoppers prepared to pounce, a familiar, sassy voice piped up. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a nervous little ant?\u201d It was **Lamb Chop**, Shari Lewis\u2019s brilliantly sassy sock puppet, who, surprisingly, was offering Flick a word of encouragement.  With Lamb Chop\u2019s surprisingly strategic advice and the help of the Painted Dragons\u2019 camouflage skills, Flick and the ants managed to outsmart the grasshoppers, proving that even the smallest creature can be a hero.",

        "unwrapped_text": "The rain in Hyrule was relentless, mirroring the despair clinging to Link. He\u2019d been tracking a strange corruption spreading through the land, a sickly purple blight that withered everything it touched. His journey had led him to a crumbling, forgotten tower, rumored to be haunted by echoes of a long-dead sorcerer. Inside, he found a single, flickering candle and a cryptic inscription: \u201cThe past remembers those who seek to control it.\u201d\n\nAs he deciphered the runes, a ghostly voice whispered, \u201cBeware the King who fears to see within.\u201d Suddenly, a shimmering projection appeared \u2013 a regal figure, clad in velvet and adorned with a heavy crown. It was **Queen Elizabeth II**, who, in a famous quote, had declared, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to open windows into men\u2019s souls.\u201d  The projection explained that the corruption stemmed from a fractured memory, a stolen piece of Hyrule\u2019s history. \n\nFollowing the ghostly guidance, Link discovered a hidden chamber containing a dusty, velvet robe. As he touched it, a flamboyant voice echoed through the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve found me!\u201d It was **David Bowie**, the iconic performer who had brilliantly embodied the mischievous Jareth the Goblin King in the film \u2018Labyrinth\u2019. Bowie\u2019s projection revealed that the sorcerer hadn\u2019t simply corrupted Hyrule; he\u2019d stolen a vital piece of the kingdom\u2019s past \u2013 a recording of a powerful, unifying song. \n\nThe trail led Link to a desolate South African landscape, where he encountered a projection of **Kevin O\u2019Connell**, the actor who portrayed Nelson Mandela in \u2018Cry Freedom\u2019. Mandela\u2019s spirit urged Link to seek justice and truth, explaining that the sorcerer had used the stolen song to sow discord and fear. \n\nFurther investigation brought Link to a gritty, rain-soaked street in London, where he found a projection of **Samantha Morton**, who portrayed the fiercely independent Valerie in \u2018Nil By Mouth\u2019.

        "raw_generated_text": "The rain in Hyrule was relentless, mirroring the despair clinging to Link. He\u2019d been tracking a strange corruption spreading through the land, a sickly purple blight that withered everything it touched. His journey had led him to a crumbling, forgotten tower, rumored to be haunted by echoes of a long-dead sorcerer. Inside, he found a single, flickering candle and a cryptic inscription: \u201cThe past remembers those who seek to control it.\u201d\n\nAs he deciphered the runes, a ghostly voice whispered, \u201cBeware the King who fears to see within.\u201d Suddenly, a shimmering projection appeared \u2013 a regal figure, clad in velvet and adorned with a heavy crown. It was **Queen Elizabeth II**, who, in a famous quote, had declared, \u201cI don\u2019t wish to open windows into men\u2019s souls.\u201d  The projection explained that the corruption stemmed from a fractured memory, a stolen piece of Hyrule\u2019s history. \n\nFollowing the ghostly guidance, Link discovered a hidden chamber containing a dusty, velvet robe. As he touched it, a flamboyant voice echoed through the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve found me!\u201d It was **David Bowie**, the iconic performer who had brilliantly embodied the mischievous Jareth the Goblin King in the film \u2018Labyrinth\u2019. Bowie\u2019s projection revealed that the sorcerer hadn\u2019t simply corrupted Hyrule; he\u2019d stolen a vital piece of the kingdom\u2019s past \u2013 a recording of a powerful, unifying song. \n\nThe trail led Link to a desolate South African landscape, where he encountered a projection of **Kevin O\u2019Connell**, the actor who portrayed Nelson Mandela in \u2018Cry Freedom\u2019. Mandela\u2019s spirit urged Link to seek justice and truth, explaining that the sorcerer had used the stolen song to sow discord and fear. \n\nFurther investigation brought Link to a gritty, rain-soaked street in London, where he found a projection of **Samantha Morton**, who portrayed the fiercely independent Valerie in \u2018Nil By Mouth\u2019. Valerie\u2019s raw honesty and unwavering spirit resonated with Link, reinforcing the importance of confronting the darkness head-on. \n\nFinally, a vibrant image filled the chamber \u2013 a young woman in a white tennis dress, radiating confidence and grace.
